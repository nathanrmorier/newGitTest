To open command on Mac: Utilities > Applications > Terminal

To open command on Windows: Run > type "CMD" and press "ENTER"

===COMMANDS===

 • cd (means change directory) so typing "cd .." will go up a directory, the space after "cd" is important.
"cd directoryName/nextDirectoryName" takes you there.

• ls (LS) gives a list of all files in current directory. In windows it's "dir", unless you have fake linux mac commands installed.

• to get the repository, get the clone URL with "git clone https://github.com/nathanrmorier/newGitTest.git"
clone is your first git command.

• "git status" this will show what's different from local file, and what's online

• "git add FILE.NAME" which means we're going to add any new files or changes by name, you would then enter the file name. You can add multiple files with “git add <filename1> <filename2>” or you can add all from the folder with “git add .”.

• Locking it into repository 'git commit -m "I added a file yall"' (the -m means you're adding a message)

• to actually sync it up us "git push" to upload onto repository.
